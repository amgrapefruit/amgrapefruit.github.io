                <p class="biography">For quite the longest time, I've had such an interest with Computer Science. The practice of building and creating was so fun, that despite the many challenges and errors encountered, seeing a project work as intended made everything feel so worth it and gratifying.</p>
                <p class="biography">Then, thanks to practicing frontend development, I've also gained an outlet for all my creative juices, making me fall all over again. Constant challenges and continuous fun have made me continue doing all the things I love up until now. The following projects are only some that reflect those experiences.</p>
